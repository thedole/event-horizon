#event-horizon
>The naming may be a little unfortunate due to the suggestion of the word "event" that might imply that this is an event library. The only reason for the name is that I wanted a non-descriptive name, a fascination for black holes, and a lack of imagination.

##Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide utility scripts for javascripts targeting the Microsoft Dynamics platform.

##Outlook
It is more then likely that this repo will only live to be my poorly organized dumping ground for Javascript snippets that I write during my spare time as they fall outside the billable scope of my day job.
